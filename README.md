# FetchDataAnalyticsOA
Step 1 of the OA is contained in the ERDiagram.jpg file. There is an outlined diagram that shows the relationships between tables, the primary keys, and the foreign keys and what foreign key in which table lines up in what foreign key in another table.
Step 2 of the OA is contained in the FinalOAFile.ipynb file. You only run the second cell once; it puts all the .csv files into one big .db file.
Step 3 of the OA is contained in the OADataAnalysisStep3.ipynb file. There are four observations made about the general data that are contained in this file. 
I had to zip the receipt_items.csv file because it was simply too big to upload. When running the code, you should unzip the file.
